        "DOCUMENT": "swg21502095",
        "ANSWER": "First remember to pack all your XOMs (eXecutable Object Model) into the ssp.war following the documentation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global720.html]. Then make sure the SSP (ssp.war) is deployed on each server along with a XU connection factory and the appropriate datasource definition.  Then create your own SSP resolver, add it to the teamserver.war and set the teamserver.defaultSSPResolver.class property to this class following this specification [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/html/api/html/ilog/rules/teamserver/model/testing/IlrSSPResolver.html].  By implementing your own method IlrSSPResolver.getSSPURL(String serverName,URL url), you will be able to point to something else than the default provider. The default provider uses the url of the Rule Execution Server passed in parameter and replaces the application name with testing. A simple implementation can use the server name to return a specific server URL.",
